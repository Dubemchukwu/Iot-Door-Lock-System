## 🚀 System Architecture

### **The Magic Happens in Three Layers:**

#### 1. **🏠 Hardware Layer (ESP32)**
Your door's digital brain that:
- Monitors keypad input continuously
- Controls the servo motor with precision
- Manages LCD display and buzzer feedback
- Maintains WiFi connection for remote commands

#### 2. **☁️ Cloud Layer (FastAPI + Render)**
The command center that:
- Receives requests from your web dashboard
- Validates security credentials
- Sends commands to your ESP32
- Handles all the heavy lifting in the cloud

#### 3. **🖥️ Interface Layer (Streamlit)**
Your control panel that:
- Provides a beautiful, responsive web interface
- Enables one-click door control
- Manages PIN changes securely
- Shows real-time system status
